# Relaxed_IK_Solver
Relaxed inverse kinematics solver.  Takes in any robot urdf, and allows for specificing general state, motion, and action goals in robot arm teleoperation

This solver was featured in the mimicry control interface, shown to be an effective way to control a robot arm by having the robot mimic a user's arm motions in real-time.  The paper discussing this method, called A Motion Retargeting Method for Effective Mimicry-based Teleoperation of Robot Arms,can be found here:

To test that the solver is working for you, start with the sample.py script in the main directory.
